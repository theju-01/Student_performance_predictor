# Student_performance_predictor
Student Performance Predictor is a Machine Learning-based project developed using Python that predicts student academic performance based on factors such as attendance, study hours, and previous marks. The system uses a regression model to analyze historical data and generate accurate predictions to support early academic intervention.
The Student Performance Predictor is a Machine Learning-based system developed using Python to predict student academic performance based on various input features such as attendance, study hours, and previous marks.

The project aims to assist educators in identifying students who may require additional academic support by analyzing historical academic data and generating performance predictions.

#Features
Predicts student marks using Machine Learning
Data preprocessing and feature selection
Model training and evaluation
Performance metrics calculation (R² Score, MAE, RMSE)
Visualization of actual vs predicted scores

#Technologies Used
Python 
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib

#Usage
Run the Python script:
python student_predictor.py
The program will:
Load the dataset
Train the regression model
Evaluate performance
Display prediction results and graph

#Machine Learning Model
The project uses Linear Regression since the output variable (student marks) is continuous in nature.
Model Evaluation Metrics:
R² Score
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

#Sample Output
The system generates:
Predicted student scores
Comparison graph of actual vs predicted values

#Future Improvements
Implement advanced models like Random Forest or XGBoost
Convert into a web application using Flask
Integrate real-time database support
Deploy on cloud platforms
